Local sequence,"the Tichitt Tradition (c. 1900–400 BC) arose, an early agropastoral economy with domestic pearl millet (Munson 1976; Amblard 1996; Fuller et al. 2007), stone architecture, and a hierarchical settlement landscape (Munson 1980; Holl 1985, 1993). Tichitt's socioeconomic trajectory has been researched and debated for decades, with Munson's work at Dhar Tichitt during the late 1960s followed by that of new researchers there and at the other escarpments (Munson 1976, Holl 1986; Vernet 1993; Ould Khattar 1995; MacDonald et al. 2009; Amblard-Pison 2006; Person et al. 2006).

Bead tradition,"Indo-Pacific Beads are rarely more than 5mm in diameter and made in a limited range of colours including: opague reddish brown, orange, yellow, green, and black as well as semi-translucent greens and blues, and translucent amber and violet. The glass often contains many bubbles and can vary in quality. The beads were so widely distributed both spatially and temporally. They were traded to West Africa with the Kingdom of Ghana by the 7th to 8th centuries Ad including at such sites as Tegdaoust in modern Mauritania, Jenne-jenno in the Interior Niger Delta of Mali, Beads may have arrived through internal African routes from East Africa. In Eastern Africa and Southern Africa, Indo-Pacific glass beads are found at numerous sites dating from the early 7th to 8th centuries (AD) onwards. For example, they have been recovered at sites such as Nzwanzi in the Comoros (11th - 15th centuries AD), post-Zhizo assemblages in southern Africa, and multiple sites along the coast of East Africa (and particularly from Swahili Stonetowns).

Bead tradition,"The Middle East and in particular Egypt and the Levant played an important part in the history of glass where it it is generally acknowledged to have been invented in Mesopotamia in the middle of the third millennium BC. Middle East glass beads are commonly referred to as Phoenician beads and are spread around the Mediterranean littoral. Innovative glass beadmaking techniques where initiated in the Helenistic times and persisted trhought the Roman Empire, into the Byzantine-Coptic periods, and until the end of the Easly Islamic Period. The most widespread of glass beads from the Middle East are small, monochrome, oblate, segmented beads recovered from Europe, Middle East, and Africa.

Archaeological period,"The Middle Stone Age (MSA) is best known for innovations that appear in the archaeological record at various times after about 300,000 years ago to 20, 000 years ago, with the first appearance of Homo sapiens. These novel behaviours embrace hafting technology, the use of compound paints and adhesives, ingenious lithic technology that included pressure flaking and the heat treatment of rock, the engraving of ochre and eggshell with geometric designs, the stringing of shell beads and the production of a wide range of bone implements. Such innovations might have been linked to new types of social behaviour stimulated by demographic pulses and movements within and out of the continent. Population shifts may have occurred repeatedly during the MSA. Southern African sites seem concentrated in the interior of the subcontinent before 130 kya. Thus, the florescence of MSA innovations described here appears to have coincided with the dispersal after 130 kya of populations from the interior to mountainous areas.

Non-specified,"It has been suggested that the effects of humans on the global environment, particularly since the Industrial Revolution, have resulted in marked changes to the Earth’s surface, and that these may be reflected in the recent stratigraphic record. The term ‘Anthropocene’ (Crutzen, 2002) has been employed informally to denote the contemporary global environment that is dominated by human activity (Andersson et al., 2005; Crossland, 2005; Zalasiewicz et al., 2010). Discussions are presently ongoing to determine whether the stratigraphic signature of the Anthropocene is sufficiently clearly defined as to warrant its formal definition as a new period of geological time. The date for the start of the Anthropocene is currently being debated with some proponents suggesting that it began with the start of the Industrial Revolution (1800s) whilst others with the testing of atomic bombs in 1945.

Archaeological period,"A period in southern Africa that marks the earliest phase of the Iron Age characterised by non-stratified communities. Several streams including the Eastern Stream (Kwale Branch) of the Urwewe Tradition in East Africa, the Central Stream or Nkope branch and the Western Stream (Kalundu Branch). The streams form broad distinctions between different ceramic assemblages and are generally associated with the emergence of the earliest farming communities. In general, this period is marked by the appearance of distinctive pottery, metal working, livestock-keeping and the cultivation of sorghum and milllet. Communities would have followed familiar habitats including regions with a relatively high rainfall (>400mm), and along predominantly open woodland savannah ecotones, preferably fertile river valley bottoms, and littoral patchy forested corridors.

Archaeological period,The period is marked by the beginning of the southern Africa's incorporation into the expanding economic system including agropastoral craft production and commercial connections with the Indian Ocean and Central Africa leading to greater socio-political complexity and the emergence of early urbanism and statehood. Late Farming Communities in southern Africa begins approximately 1000 CE and continues into the historic period. Linguistic evidence suggests that ancestors of present-day language or dialect groups in southern Africa date from the early second millennium AD.

Local sequence,"The most important archaeological sites at Gao itself are Gao-Sané (a tell north of the modern town) and Gao Ancien (beneath it) (Insoll 1997, 2000). One or both probably formed the centre of the ‘kingdom of Kawkaw’ referred to by Al-Yaqūbī in 872(3). Unfortunately, extensive looting at Gao-Sané has precluded its further dating beyond estimates obtained by the Malian Mission Inventaire of the 1980s (Raimbault and Sanogo 1991). Early occupation layers at Gao Ancien date to the middle centuries of the first millennium AD (Insoll 1998, 2000), allowing ample time for the development of the substantial polity noted by Al-Yaqūbī.

Ceramic,"The most common decorative technique in Period or Phase 1 is twine impression. Over 50 percent of the sherds from this Phase are decorated with twine alone. About 9 percent of sherds from this phase have fine channeling along the lip of the rim. When twine is present on the early sherds it is often incorporated onto the lip of the rim, as well as the shoulder and body.

In the contexts of archaeology, palaeontology, and palaeoanthropology, the Plio-Pleistocene is a very useful period to which scientists may assign the long and continuous run in East Africa of datable sedimentary layers and their contents (e.g. the Bouri Formation). These contents collectively present a focused view of the continuous evolution of the region's large vertebrates, especially the evolution of some African apes (hominids) to the earliest hominins; and then the development of the early humans and their toolmaking cultures. This shorter pseudo-period—from after 5 Mya to about 1.5 Mya—straddles the boundary between the Pliocene and the Pleistocene.

Lithic industry,"The LSA in Ethiopia is characterised with the development of a microlithic industry. Many terminologies have been applied to this period including the Mode 4-5 Industry, Blade Mode 4 Industry, as well as the Ethiopian Blade Tool Tradition which has been divided into three discrete temporal phases. Currently, the earliest date for the start of the LSA in Ethiopia is 27 kya. Evidence indicates that microlithic tools were being manufactured well within the Aksumite Period in the form of highly standardised scrapers. Microlithic technologies also co-occur with the first evidence of pottery in northern Ethiopia dated to around 4700 years ago and with the presence of domestic livestock in the faunal remains.

The pottery has thick beveled rims which are often incised or grooved, and the assemblage consists of necked pots and shallow hemispheric bowls with a dimpled base. This pottery is heavily decorated but the decorations do not cover the entire body. The basic motif is parallel grooved or incised bands around the shoulder and body, that often incorporates circles, loops and triangles. Hatching and dots are often found on or just below the rim.

Ceramic tradition,"Tana ware (also called Early Tana Tradition pottery or Triangular-Incised Ware) refers to a type of pottery produced in East Africa in the late 1st millennium. The presence of this pottery is largely regarded as one of the best indicators for early Swahili settlement, and the name Tana was given because the early discoveries of these types of pottery were along the Tana River in present day Kenya. As indicated by the name, this pottery features particular type of decoration in the form of triangular incised lines and a single row of dots. and also fingernail pinches, parallel horizontal lines, shell edge punctuates and a cross hatching on rims. Tana has five main vessel types - necked jars, globular jars, open bowls, closed bowls, and carinated bowls.

Polity,"The spread of a new culture can be traced by the distribution of Mapungubwe pottery. This style developed between AD 1220 and AD 1250. The pottery is named after the capital of Mapungubwe situated in the Shashe-Limpopo River Basin. This site is identified as a rainmaking hill with sacred leadership and a dual settlement system indicating a class-based society. The site of Mapungubwe is believed to have been abandoned from around AD 1300 relating to climatic change and marking the beginning of the 'Little Ice Age'. Description of Mapungubwe site: 'The inhabitants of this town, who probably numbered more than 5,000, traded in copper, iron, ivory, glass beads, and gold, which is the reason why their rulers were so wealthy. The burial evidence from the hilltop shows considerable social stratification'.

Ceramic tradition,Moloko is characterised by its ceramic tradition and have traditionally been divided into four main time segments. The first segment dating between 1300 CE and 1450 CE has been related to Icon and sites with this pottery occur predominantly in the Limpopo Province of South Africa and possibly in southeastern Botswana. During the second phase of the Moloko tradition there is a southwards expansion onto the Western Highveld in South Africa. Early Moloko sites are found in southeastern Botswana and in the northern parts of eastern South Africa dating from the 14th century CE. Sites tend to have a central cattle enclosure (kraal) with surrounding houses. Towards the end of the second phase and during the third phase (1500 - 1700 CE) low-stone walling appears with shifts in settlement organisation. The fourth phase of the Moloko ceramic sequence is suggested to be ancestral to Sotho and Tswana speaking communities dating back to the 18th and 19th centuries. Three ceramic types are seen to have developed from the Moloko second phase: Letsibogo (eastern Botswana) Madikwe (southeastern Botswana and the North-West Province of South Africa) and Olifantspoort (Magaliesberg South Africa). Early ceramic assemblages (before 1700 CE) have a relatively high stylistic variability with a large number of decorated bowl classes.

Polity,During the 15th Century Great Zimbabwe lost some of its influence in the northern and western parts of the Zimbabwe Plateau with the appearance of other centres constucted along similar lines to Great Zimbabwe. One of which was the formation of the Mutapa State beginning around c.1450 in northern Zimbabwe. The rise of the Mutapa State is captured extensively in Portuguese written sources where early Portuguese explorers in the interior reported stone buildings. Archaeological evidence also indicates the presence of imported artefacts through trade with eastern Africa as well as locally manufactured pottery that have been related to the ethnic group of the Karanga. This has also been attested to by Portuguese records. By the 16th Century African-Portuguese trading posts and settlements are found and associated with locally manufactured pottery as well as traded items including imported ceramics and glass. It is also at the beginning of the 16th Century where stone-building ceases with the emergence of non-stone-walled royal courts. The decline of the Mutapa State has been suggested to be triggered by the exploitative nature of the Portuguese merchants and conquistadores in northern Zimbabwe in connection with goldmining and the subsequent building of fortifications by the late 16th and early 17th century. The crudely built stone defenses or wooden stockades were often erected on hilltops.Ceramic evidence from these hillforts suggest that the Budya or related Tonga groups from the lower Zambezi as the builders.'

Architectural style,The Nyanga Complex (architectural) represents an agricultural society of industrious farmers and stock-raisers. Sites are mostly characterised by stone-faced terraces covering hills and valleys as well as stone-built homesteads and defensive forts or refuges extending from Ruangwe in the north of Nyanga District to the Pungwe Valley in the south to Cumberland Valley Burnaby in the south west and into Tanda/Chinyika west of the Nyangombe river of Zimbabwe. This covers an area of some 5000 square kilometres. Areas with lesser outlying occurrences are in the Makha area of Mutoko west of Headlands/Weya and south of Chimanimani. The walled villages with linteled entrances in the area northeast of Rusape including at Diana's Vow site and at the site Harleigh Farm are thought to be related to the Nyanga Complex.

Geological event,"Around the transition between the first and second millennium CE is a period widely referred to as the Medieval Climate Anomaly. Hemisphere-wide and global syntheses suggest that this period was generally warmer than the subsequent Little Ice Age. Tyson et al. (2000) suggest that warming may have increased by as much as ~+3°C, south of Lake Malawi. The timing and spatial variability of the MCA is considered to be highly complex with high resolution records being comparatively patchy in terms of geographical coverage across Africa. General synthesis indicates that the MCA was wetter than today across the Sahel. In the more humid regions south of the Sahel, the MCA has been suggested to be relatively arid with sites across East Africa from Ethopia to northern Malawi being drier than average. In Southern African records indicate that the period is characterised generally by increased humidity and warm conditions between 900 CE and 1250 and were interrupted by significantly drier conditions at around c. 1200 CE, although on the southeastern side of southern Africa, records seem to show greater variability (see also Nash 2016 for an overview)",Medieval Climate Epoch,,900,has broader term (has narrower term),CE,,Primary name,,1250,900,CHRN-00000096,"Africa, Primary name",Late Holocene,,,CE,,1250,63f538a3-2b5b-4176-aa29-3cf506496472

,"While the use of coral had been restricted to a selection of religious and civic buildings in the first millennium, in the second it was used to build houses of certain elites. Some towns came to have dozens of such houses, but more typically there were a handful, or none at all. The presence of ‘stone’ houses and other buildings came to define Swahili townscapes and provide an index of the wealth and power of this period (Garlake 1966; Allen 1979; Kusimba 1999; Horton and Middleton 2000; Wynne-Jones 2013, 2016).

Polity,By about 1270 a wealthy elite had emerged at Great Zimbabwe which laid the foundations of an elaborate urban complex and the centre of a state constructing stone buildings of unparalleled scale and magnitude from about 1300 (Garlake 1973). For the next 150 years Great Zimbabwe became the dominant political authority south of the Zambezi (Huffman 1996 2007). Great Zimbabwe reached its peak during the 14th and 15th centuries when elaborate stone walling that symbolized wealth power and status was extended towards outlying areas. With an estimated population of nearly 20000 Great Zimbabwe was the largest metropolis in southern Africa. Ceramics: Incisions graphite burnishing occasional polychrome. Architecture: Freestanding walls occasional terraces.

Architectural style,Earliest walling with no clear courses and flourished between AD 1085 and 1450.

Walling was built with clear courses (neatly coursed) that can be traced over long distance and built with dressed blocks of a regular size and shape. The chronology of the different styles of walling for Zimbabwe culture sites was based at Great Zimbabwe by Summers Robinson and Whitty (1961).

Ceramic,"Horizon III shows many similarities with the older Horizon IV. The production of white paste pottery with red slip-coated walls is still present. The range of vessels includes bowls, jars, base vases and cylinder vases. However, some changes are significant. First of all, in terms of quantity, the overall number of white paste vessels has decreased significantly compared to Horizon IV. This is particularly striking for cylindrical vessels, where only a few elements with discontinuous, and especially continuous, profiles remain. If the organisation of the decorations on these potteries does not vary. The evidence suggests the existence of two groups of potters sharing a common technical tradition and whose productions, although distinct, show marked borrowing phenomena.",Central facies horizon III (ceramic),,1000,has broader term (has narrower term),CE,,Primary name,,1200,1000,CHRN-00000401,"Senegal, Primary name",Central facies (Senegal),, Variation in the Early Iron Age of Southeastern Botswana.,CE,,1200,e2036a08-5103-4c84-b15d-aa5b3498b660
